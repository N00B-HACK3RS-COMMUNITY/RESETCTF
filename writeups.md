flag submitted by [_@hacker_oneness](https://www.instagram.com/hack3r_oneness/)_ , **Captain**

This flag was very simple but when i first looked at this i was quite confused. I thought it is ROT13, by the time i figured it out what it was my teammate already submitted the flag

It was quite simple the text was reversed. I used [Cyberchef](http://icyberchef.com/) tool to get the flag, whereas you can do it manually too.
