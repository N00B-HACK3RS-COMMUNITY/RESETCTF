flag submitted by [_@hacker_oneness](https://www.instagram.com/hack3r_oneness/)_ , **Captain**

This flag was very simple but when i first looked at this i was quite confused. I thought it is ROT13, by the time i figured it out what it was my teammate already submitted the flag

It was quite simple the text was reversed. I used [Cyberchef](http://icyberchef.com/) tool to get the flag, whereas you can do it manually too.

A hacker can guess at a glance that it is encoded in BASE64 **`‚ÄúUkVTVENPTntSRVNUQ09OXzJORF9CQVNJQ19GTEFHfQ==‚Äú`**

> _Note:- Base64 has ‚Äú==‚Äù at the end of their strings_

In CyberChef, search ‚ÄúBase64‚Äù in search box drag and drop it in Recipe column and paste the above text in input column

flag submitted by [_@JayaLakshmi_](https://www.instagram.com/jayalakshmi7599/) , **CTF Team member**

In this Challenge they gave file named ‚ÄúChal.txt‚Äù. We can download the file by clicking on the ‚Äù Chal file ‚Äù . But i used Linux Command ‚Äúwget <file-URL>‚Äù and downloaded in specific folder through my terminal 
  
When i opened this file i saw this text **```‚Äú ;FOM6VgI(;FOM6VgHa5u(3T84?E`6:‚ÄùOA6XN;V5t?> ‚Äú```**

Got to know that it is ASCII85 by searching on [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/) website after decoding i got the flag.

This flag took me only 25 seconds to capture. As in above image ‚ÄúYour Flag is hear‚Äù and a undefined image link. Simply i did a **right click > copy Image location** and created new tab and paste the image link

It was showing **‚Äú404 error‚Äù** with **‚ÄúFile not found, Sorry about that‚Äù** Then i looked at the URL there i saw **‚Äúhttps://ctf.resethacker/`RESTCON{HIDD3N}`‚Äú**

flag submitted by [_@106_Sam_](https://www.instagram.com/106_sam/) , **CTF Team member**

This challenge gave us a file named ‚Äúgarbage.txt‚Äù which was corrupted. As this file got corrupted the file got itself converted into binary data.

So first step i did when i downloaded this file using linux command **‚Äúwget‚Äù** is i used Command **‚Äúfile (file-name)‚Äù** to check what type of Data is inside the file **garbage.txt**

Second step : i used command **‚Äúcat garbage.txt | grep RESTCON ‚Äù** to know if the flag is there in it or not. I got to know that **‚ÄúBinary input(standard input) matches"**

> _Note : command ‚Äòcat‚Äô is used to list whats inside the file , symbol ‚Äò|‚Äô this is called ‚ÄòPipe‚Äô it is used to divided the command , command ‚Äògrep‚Äô it is used to search the specific text from the given file and shows us._

Third step : i just simply used ‚Äòcat garbage.txt‚Äô to list the text inside the file. The file was filled with the binary data‚Ä¶but at the end there was the flag **‚ÄúRESTCON{GR3P_7HE_FL4GS}‚Äú**.

there is another way of finding the flag just use command **‚Äústrings (file-name)‚Äù**

flag submitted by [_@106_Sam_](https://www.instagram.com/106_sam/) , **CTF Team member**

When i clicked **‚ÄúFile‚Äù** a file named **‚Äúweirdo1.txt‚Äù** was download. When i **‚Äúcat weirdo1.txt"**. There was lot of symbols, alphabets, and etc. It took so much time to figure out what can this message be i tried reversing and i was checking for metadata of the file etc. Then i thought it might be some other type of morse code(but it wan‚Äôt). After doing much research got to know that it is **‚ÄúMalbolge Programming Language‚Äù**.

>_Note: Malbolge, invented by Ben Olmstead in 1998, is an esoteric programming language designed to be as difficult to program in as possible. And so it is üôÇ _

I used a online interpreter to compile and capturing the flag [Malbolge](http://malbolge.doleczek.pl/)

# In Plain Sight

This was a difficult one as u can see only 29 Solves.

Thanks to _[m3ta_c1ph4r](https://medium.com/@ashutoshg547) A.k.a [Ashutosh Gupta](https://medium.com/@ashutoshg547)_ for solution

So if you will see it just says as a normal plain text. If you google this as you will see a song name. But it is nothing related to the this question. So I directly to the solution. If you notice **‚Äúbum bum, tam tam tam.‚Äù** the last **‚Äò.‚Äô** if you click on that it is a hyperlink. It will download one file. When you open it you will see some strange sentences. So to solve this I made a python script.

So in this script it will print those characters which are CAPITAL. So when you execute this script you will see this output **‚ÄúYOUGOTTHEFLAGFROMBUMTAMTAM‚Äù**. So in the question you will see that they said **‚ÄúFlag is in Leet Speak language‚Äù**. So I just google this and I found this on [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/leet-speak-1337) . And when you tap on the encode .

>_Note: dcode.fr is a french sites, it is one of the best site for encoding and decoding text_

So firstly I tried that leet code but that didn‚Äôt work so I tried that above. And it worked.
